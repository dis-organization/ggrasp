# ggrasp

gg and R and sp

This is the "vector" version of tabularaster. 

Write analogy to gggeom to have doubly nested tables. 

```{r}
library(ggrasp)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)

data(holy_poly)
spdata <- spbabel::sp(holy_poly, attr_tab = tibble(mydat = c("a", "b", "c")))
ggg <- nest(spdata)
plot(ggg, col = rainbow(nrow(ggg), alpha = 0.5))
```

Use this basis to build data+pslg version atts, 1D primitives, vertices (unique). 


Decompose to just edges. 

```{r}
#edges <- primitives1D()
```

Use that to build 2D primitives. 

Round trip from sp to branches to primitives to sp. Leverage sp/rgeos/rgdal for spatial ops, ggvis for visualization.
