# ggrasp

gg and R and sp

This is the "vector" version of tabularaster. 

Extend gggeom to have doubly nested tables. 

Use this basis to build data+pslg version atts, 1D primitives, vertices (unique)
Use that to build 2D primitives. 

Round trip from sp to branches to primitives to sp. Leverage sp/rgeos/rgdal for spatial ops, ggvis for visualization.
